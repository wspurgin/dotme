I'm a software craftsmen producing bugs in the Dallas area. My main language of
choice Ruby, but I've dabbled in everything from PHP, Python, R, C, C++, Lisp,
Java, and JavaScript.

To learn more about me, I highly suggest checking out the prank blog my
friends setup to mess with me: [http://wspurgin.us](http://wspurgin.us)
