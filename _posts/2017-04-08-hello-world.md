>`puts "Hello, World."`

From the depths of time (the 1970s to [be exact][b-tutorial]) weekend hackers,
professional software craftsmen, moonlight code monkeys, and geeks of all sorts
have been giving their salutations to various "worlds". Today, I'm doing the
same to the saturated-personal-opinion-my-thoughts-matter-blog one. So,

**Hi, I'm Will.**

If you couldn't tell, I like code. I am currently an aspiring Rubiest, Vimer,
and web application developer. I dabble in a variety of other languages, but a
majority of my experience outside of Ruby is in Python, C++ and C. Outside of
that, I am a lover of puns, enjoy history, and like science I can't understand.
As soon as someone invents an HD computer monitor that has 0 glare in the sun,
I'll be coding outside for the rest of my days. Or I'll be in space. There's no
telling for sure.

Now to the important stuff: What the heck am I gonna talk about on my blog?

Your guess is as good as mine. Per my rather hastily written site description:
"musings" of a semi-random nature. *Spoiler*, This is the Internet, so I have 0
expectations for anyone to read this nor for anyone to want to read anything I
write in the future. However, if you do, tweet at me (handle is
<a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}">
<span class="icon icon--twitter">{% include icon-twitter.svg %}</span>
<span class="username">{{ site.twitter_username }}</span>
</a>)
if you have suggestions or topic requests. Or you can comment using Disqus
(though I'll be less likely to notice those and respond aptly).

K, bye World.
